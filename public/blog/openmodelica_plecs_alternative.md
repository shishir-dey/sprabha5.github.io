Hello everyone,

While exploring free alternatives to PLECS, I discovered OpenModelica, and I was genuinely surprised by how powerful it is.

As power electronics engineers, we all know the importance of PLECS software. But honestly, it is disappointing that it is paid, and we need a free tool with similar practical functionality.

Most power electronics simulation tools today are expensive and require paid licenses, including PLECS, MATLAB Simulink, and PSIM.

OpenModelica is a completely free and open-source software that can perform a lot in power electronics:

- Converter-level switching simulations
- Closed-loop control simulations
- System-level modeling

I have made a video to introduce OpenModelica and started a complete power electronics simulation tutorial series using it.

Moving forward in this series, I will try simulations of:

- DC-DC converters
- AC-DC converters
- Inverters
- Control loops

Simulation is a daily requirement for power electronics engineers, whether you are a student, researcher, or working professional.

However, not everyone has access to expensive licensed software, especially students and early-stage engineers.

Since OpenModelica is free and open-source, I decided to start this complete tutorial series so that learning and experimentation become more accessible to everyone.

OpenModelica is based on the Modelica object-oriented, equation-based modeling language and is widely used in:

- Industry
- Research
- Automotive systems
- Power systems
- Control engineering

It is:

- Multi-domain
- Numerically stable
- Capable of both system-level and switching-level modeling
