# Reflections on Pain

"How will you describe pain,  
Pain which is inside you,  
Pain which you grew with,  
Pain which founds the comfort inside  
you and makes you uncomfortable,  
Pain which you can tell the world,  
Pain which makes you hollow,  
Pain which can't just go away,  
Even if you keep trying,  
Pain which eventually surrounds,  
Even when you are alone,  
How will you describe the pain,  
which never ends,  
Which can't let you be happy,  
Which can't let your brain rest,  
Which made you hyper in every sense,  
Active, emotional, sensitive,  
How will you describe the pain,  
Which you keep questioning,  
Why me, why now, why again,  
Pain which reside insides you  
Pain which surrounds your soul,  
Like the roots of a tree,  
But instead of making stronger  
it weaken you to core,  
If I had a desire,  
I'll never want to have that pain,  
Which make me suffer,  
which cost me everything,  
My peace, my happiness & Me."

> It sits inside the chest,  
> heavy yet hollow,  
> restless yet numb.  
>
> It makes you alert, emotional, sensitive,  
> not because you want to be  
> but because your heart never gets to rest.  
>
> It is the pain that doesn’t break you at once,  
> it slowly reshapes you,  
> until you no longer remember  
> who you were before it arrived.
