This is a cheap, safe, battery-powered adapter for measuring high voltages (up to 600V) with a standard oscilloscope.

Why it's good:

• Cheap: Way less expensive than professional tools.
• Safe: Isolates the scope from dangerous high voltage.
• Portable: Runs on a rechargeable battery.
• Accurate: Stays accurate over time with calibration.

It's a low-cost, safe gadget that lets teachers and students measure dangerous high voltages using their regular lab equipment.
